# Dependency Injection & Services

When you develop a smaller part of your system, like a module or a class, you may need to use features from other classes. For example, you may need an HTTP service to make backend calls. Dependency Injection, or DI, is a design pattern and mechanism for creating and delivering some parts of an application to other parts of an application that require them. Angular supports this design pattern and you can use it in your applications to increase flexibility and modularity.
